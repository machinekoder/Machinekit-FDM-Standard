* Machinekit Flavor GCode

** GCodes

*** [[./subroutines/g22.ngc][G22]]: Retract Extruder

Retracts the currently active extruder.

*** [[./subroutines/g23.ngc][G23]]: Unretract Extruder

Unetracts the currently active extruder.

*** [[./subroutines/g28.ngc][G28]]: Move to Origin

Example: =G28=

This code exists for compatibility reasons with RepRap flavor GCode.
Machinekit does not support homing from GCode as homing needs to be
triggered from the user interface. This code causes the FDM machine to
move back to its X, Y and Z zero coordinates and resets the extruder
axis.

If you add coordinates, then just the axes with coordinates specified
will be zeroed. Thus =G28 X0 Y72.3= will zero the X and Y axes, but not
Z. The actual coordinate values are ignored.

*** [[./subroutines/g29.ngc][G29]]: Detailed Z-Probe

Example: =G29=

Probes the bed at a specified number of point points (usually 3-4).

*** [[./subroutines/g29_1.ngc][G29.1]]: Set Z probe head offset

Example: =G29.1 X30 Y20 Z0.5=

Set the offset of the Z probe head. The offset will be subtracted from
all probe moves.

*** [[./subroutines/g29_2.ngc][G29.2]]: Set Z probe head offset
calculated from toolhead position

Example: =G29.2 Z0.0=

Set the offset of the Z probe head. The offset will be subtracted from
all probe moves. The calculated value is derived from the distance of
the toolhead from the current axis zero point.

The user would typically place the toolhead at the zero point of the
axis and issue the G29.2 command.

*** [[./subroutines/g30.ngc][G30]]: Single Z Probe

Example: =G30 X10 Y0=

In its simplest form probes bed at current XY location.

If X, or Y values are specified (e.g. =G30 X20 Y50=) then those values
are used instead of the machine's current coordinates. The combination
of these options allows for the machine to be moved to points using G1
commands, and then probe the bed, or for the user to position the nozzle
interactively and use those coordinates. The user can also record those
values and place them in a setup GCode file for automatic execution.


** MCodes

Machinekit supports a number of FDM specific MCodes inspired by the
[[http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code][RepRap MCodes]]. These codes are
implemented using remapping. If you are interested in developing your
own Machinekit based 3D printer take a look at the [[./remap.ini][remap
file]].

*** [[./subroutines/m104.ngc][M104]]: Set Extruder Temperature

Example: =M104 P190=

Set the temperature of the current extruder to 190 °C and return control
to the host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached
by the extruder).

**** Multiple Exruders

M104 can be additionally used to handle all devices using a temperature
sensor. It supports the additional T parameter, which is a zero-based
index into the list of sensors. For devices without a temp sensor, see
M106.

Example: =M104 T1 P100=

Set the temperature of the device attached to the second temperature
sensor to 100 °C.

*** [[./subroutines/m106.ngc][M106]]: Fan On

Example: =M106 P127=

Turn on the cooling fan at half speed.

Mandatory parameter 'S' declares the PWM value (0-255). M106 S0 turns
the fan off.

*** [[./subroutines/m107.ngc][M107]]: Fan Off

Example: =M107=

Turn on the cooling fan off.

Deprecated. Use =M106 P0= instead. (But used by Slic3r)

**** Additional Fans/Devices

Additionally to the above, Machinekit uses M106 to control general
devices. It supports the additional T parameter, which is an zero-based
index into the list of fans/devices.

Example: =M106 T2 P255=

Turn on device #3 at full speed/wattage.

**** Sync with Motion

By default the M106 command will be executed with the next movement.
This default behavior is used since the fan speed is constantly switched
during execution and an unsynchronized movement would break look-ahead
and path blending. For the purpose of executing a command immediately
the M106 supports the additional I parameter.

Example: =M106 I1 P127=

Turn on the cooling fan at half speed immediately. =I0= equals to not
immediate, all other values evaluate to immediate if I is specified.

*** [[./subroutines/m109.ngc][M109]]: Set Extruder Temperature and Wait

Example: =M109 P185=

Set extruder heater temperature in degrees celsius and wait for this
temperature to be achieved.

**** Multiple Exruders

Similar to M104 this command supports the additional T parameter for
specifying the extruder.

Example: =M109 T1 P100=

Set the temperature of the device attached to the second temperature
sensor to 100 °C and wait for the temperature to be reached.

*** [[./subroutines/m140.ngc][M140]]: Bed Temperature (Fast)

Example: =M140 P55=

Set the temperature of the build bed to 55 °C and return control to the
host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the
bed).

*** [[./subroutines/m141.ngc][M141]]: Chamber Temperature (Fast)

Example: =M141 P30=

Set the temperature of the chamber to 30 °C and return control to the
host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the
chamber).

*** [[./subroutines/m190.ngc][M190]]: Wait for bed temperature to reach
target temp

Example: =M190 P60=

Set the temperature of the build bed to 60 °C and wait for the
temperature to be reached.

*** [[./subroutines/m191.ngc][M191]]: Wait for chamber temperature to
reach target temp

Example: =M191 P60=

Set the temperature of the build chamber to 60 °C and wait for the
temperature to be reached.

*** [[./subroutines/m200.ngc][M200]]: Set filament diameter

Example: =M200 D1.75=

=M200 Dm.mmm= sets the filament diameter to m.mmm millimeters. It is
used with 'volumetric calibration' and G-code generated for an ideal
1.128mm diameter filament, which has a volume of 1mm\^3 per millimeter.
The intention is to be able to generate filament-independent g-code.

*** [[./subroutines/m207.ngc][M207]]: Set retract parameters

Example =M207 P0.5 Q10.0=

Sets retract length =P= in mm and retract velocity =Q= in mm/s.

*** [[./subroutines/m221.ngc][M221]]: Set extrusion scale

Example: =M221 P0.96= sets the extrusion scale factor to 96%

Sets the scale factor that will be applied on the extrusion in percent of the
standard extrusion output.

*** [[./subroutines/m226.ngc][M226]]: Gcode Initiated Pause

Example: =M226=

Initiates a pause in the same way as if the pause button is pressed.
That is, program execution is stopped and the printer waits for user
interaction. This matches the behaviour of M1 in the
[[http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=823374][NIST
RS274NGC G-code standard]].

*** [[./subroutines/m280.ngc][M280]]: Set servo position

Example: =M280 T0 P1500=

Set servo position absolute. T: servo index, P: angle or microseconds

*** [[./subroutines/m300.ngc][M300]]: Play beep sound

Usage: =M300 Q<frequency Hz> P<duration ms>=

Example: =M300 Q300 P1000=

Play beep sound, use to notify important events like the end of
printing. The P parameter is optional and may not be supported by all
electronics that implement the buzzer.

*** [[./subroutines/m400.ngc][M400]]: Wait for current moves to finish

Example: =M400=

Finishes all current moves and and thus clears the buffer. That's
identical to =G4 P0=.

*** [[./subroutines/m420.ngc][M420]]: Set RGBW Colors as PWM

Usage:
=M420 T<LED index (0-2)> R<Red PWM (0-1)> E<Green PWM (0-1)> D<Blue PWM (0-1)> P<White PWM (0-1)>=

Example: =M420 R1.0 E1.0 D1.0 P1.0=

Set the color of your RGBW LEDs that are connected to PWM-enabled pins.
Note, the Green color is controlled by the E value instead of the G
value due to the G code being a primary code that cannot be overridden.
The optional T parameter specifies the index of the LEDs to set (default
0).

*** [[./subroutines/m700.ngc][M700]]: Set line cross section

Example: =M700 P0.061=

Sets the cross section for a line to extrude in velocity extrusion mode.
When the extruder is enabled and movement is executed the amount of
extruded filament will be calculated to match the specified line cross
section.

*** [[./subroutines/m701.ngc][M701]]: Set line width

Example: =M701 P0.2=

Sets the width of a line to extrude in velocity extrusion mode. The value will
be used in combination with the line height to calculate the line cross
section.

*** [[./subroutines/m702.ngc][M702]]: Set line height

Example: =M702 P0.15=

Sets the height of a line to extrude in velocity extrusion mode. The value will
be used in combination with the line height to calculate the line cross
section.

*** [[./subroutines/m710.ngc][M710]]: Jog filament
Usage: =M710 P<length in mm> Q<velocity in mm/s> E<continuous 0 or 1>=

Example:
=M710 P10.0 Q2.0= extrude 10mm of filament with a velocity of 2mm/s
=M710 Q4.0 E1= start continuous extrusion with a velocity of 4mm/s

Extrudes a certain amount of filament with the specified extrusion
velocity. Extrusion velocity can be either positive or negative. The
continuous parameter starts or stops continuously extruding filament with a
specified velocity.


** RepRap Alternatives

Some RepRap GCodes can not be implemented but easily replaced by native
Machinekit GCodes.

*** M206: Set home offset

Replacement: =G10 L2 P1 X10.0 Y10.0 Z-0.4=

The values specified are added to the endstop position when the axes are
referenced. The same can be achieved with a G92 right after homing (G28,
G161).

*** M306: Set home offset calculated from toolhead position

Replacement: =G10 L20 P1 X10.0 Y10.0 Z-0.4=

The values specified are added to the calculated end stop position when
the axes are referenced. The calculated value is derived from the
distance of the toolhead from the current axis zero point.

The user would typically place the toolhead at the zero point of the
axis and issue the M306 command.
